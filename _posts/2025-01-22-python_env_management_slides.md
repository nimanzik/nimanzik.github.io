I gave a presentation on Python environment management to my junior colleagues on 22 January 2025.

Python environment management is a crucial aspect of MLOps, as it ensures that the same environment is used for development, testing, and production. In this presentation, I covered the importance of Python environment management and demonstrated how to use `uv` to manage Python environments. I also touched upon using `mypy` to type check Python codes, `black` to format Python codes, and `pytest` to test Python codes (which is important for ensuring code quality and preventing bugs).
