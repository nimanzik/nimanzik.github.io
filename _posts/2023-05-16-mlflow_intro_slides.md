I gave a presentation on MLflow to my junior colleagues on 16 May 2023.

MLflow is an open-source platform designed to streamline the ML and DL model lifecycle, from experimentation to deployment. In this presentation, I covered MLflow's core components, that are **Tracking**, **Projects**, **Models**, and **Model Registry**, and demonstrated how they help manage ML and DL workflows.

The [presentation slides](/assets/files/2023-05-16_mlflow_intro_slides/presentation.pdf){:target="_blank"} are available for download.
